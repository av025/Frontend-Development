    <h1>Adding Images in our webpage</h1>
    <p>To add images in our web page we are using img tag for that</p>
    <img src="images/download.jpeg" alt="Scenery" />
    <!--? img tag which has two attributes src means source to add source of our image and second was alt which means alternative to give alternative text if the image was not rendered. In alt attribute we have to write what was the image means describe the image properly and it was SEO friendly (Search engines friendly) also to describe picture properly . For Partially impaired people there was a screen reader technology who reads the screen and explain the content of webpage. -->

    <!--! We see that image does not have closing tag So it was Self Closing Tag in HTML -->
    <!--* HTML has two types of html tag -->
    <!--* 1st) Opening and closing tag for example h1 tag , p tag etc. -->
    <!--* 2nd) Self Closing tag which does not need the closing tag for example img tag , br tag { These tag for break the line} -->

    <img src="images/download_.jpeg" alt="Scenary" />

    <p>
      We add above image with the help of img tag in which have two attributes
      "src" which means source and "alt" which means alternative
    </p>

    <h2>When image was not rendered than alternative text was rendered</h2>
    <img src="images/download_.jpeg1" alt="Scenery" />
