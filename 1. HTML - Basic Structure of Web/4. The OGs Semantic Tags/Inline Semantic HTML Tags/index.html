      Similarly we also have Inline Semantic HTML element which also convey
      meaning. The Two most important Inline Semantic HTML tags are :-
    </p>
    <ul style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600">
      <li>em tag</li>
      <li>strong tag</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>em tag</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 22px">
      em tag was used for that website content on which we want to emphasis it
      means give concentrate on that ( In hindi meaning kisi Shabdh pe jorr
      dena)

      <br />
      <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bolder"
        >em tag was do italics our content or text
      </span>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 22px">

      </span>
    </p>
    <h2>strong tag</h2>

      importance to that particular content.
