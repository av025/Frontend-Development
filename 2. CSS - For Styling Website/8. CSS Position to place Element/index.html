    <h2>Static Position</h2>
    <p>
      Static property was the default position property which set of all html
      element by User agent Stylesheet. We can not place static position html
      element according to our need because it is always positioned according to
      the normal flow of the page.
      <br />
      <span
        >Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left,
        and right properties.</span
      >
    </p>
    <h3>Example of Static Position property</h3>
    <div class="example">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Suscipit,
      tempora? Neque ex laborum tempore maxime natus quaerat quae, animi
      expedita voluptates nemo, molestias iure quasi recusandae hic similique
      eligendi dolores.
    </div>
    <p>
      Default mainly all html element are in static position but we are also
      give example position static manually and those four properties top,bottom
      , right and left are also not working on that.
