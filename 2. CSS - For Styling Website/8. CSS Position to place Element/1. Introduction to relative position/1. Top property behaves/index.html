    <h1>Top property with relative unit</h1>
    <p>
      When we give relative position to any html than we got access of 4
      properties with the help of we can give position to our html element. When
      we apply those 4 position on it than they work opposite of the position
      name they where go away from the position. We can see with example of top
      property.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of top property with relative position</h2>
    <div class="example-top">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Mollitia eligendi
      harum ipsam explicabo blanditiis culpa officia iste dolorem cupiditate
      enim.
    </div>
    <p class="explanation">
      When we give top property 100px to above html element than it will move
      towards down and placed 100px below from the it's original top position.
      <span
        >So when we give top postion to it element will move away from top and
        create gap between them.</span
      >
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>Giving negative value to top position property</h2>
      <div class="example-negativeValue">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Mollitia
        eligendi harum ipsam explicabo blanditiis culpa officia iste dolorem
        cupiditate enim.
      </div>
      <p>
        Above we give top position property in negative value -100px. When we
        give -100px than it will work just opposite to it our html element will
        come to it's inital position before applying top property. When we give
        negative value element will not move away from position it move towards
        top position same like
        <span>bottom property</span>.
