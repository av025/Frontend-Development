    <h1>Precedance between top and bottom property</h1>
    <p>
      When we give both property together top and bottom relative position html
      element than Precedance was occur.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of Precedance between top and bottom property</h2>
    <h3>Parent Element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="child-element">Child element</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Here the precedance was occur in above example we give child element
      relative position and than we give top property 400px and bottom property
      400px but here bottom property was not applied and top property takes
      precedance because
      <span
        >Our HTML document was starts from top and go down to bottom when we are
        apply both property top and bottom together than collision happen and
        browser was confuse what property we have to apply and defaulty top
        property takes precedance.</span
