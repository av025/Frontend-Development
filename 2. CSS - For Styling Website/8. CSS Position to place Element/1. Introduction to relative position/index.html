    <h1>Introduction to Relative position</h1>
    <p>
      When we are give relative positio to HTML element than it was relative to
      it's normal position. After giving relative position we can got access of
      4 other properties to position our html element in
      <span>top property</span>, <span>bottom property</span>,
      <span>left property</span>, and <span>right property</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Example giving relative posiion to html element</h2>
    <div class="first-div">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Earum,
      aspernatur ut! Non nesciunt eum aperiam ipsum aliquam molestias officiis
      esse. Iste nisi quibusdam dicta assumenda totam nulla blanditiis hic
      impedit?
    </div>
    <p>
      above html element give position relative and we can see the position
      property in chrome dev tools also in box-model over margin on another box
      was also added which was Position box and this was not part of box model.
      than we get access of other properties <span>top property</span>,
      <span>bottom property</span>, <span>left property</span>, and
      <span>right property</span> and we give position according to our
      requirement.
    </p>
    <h2>Giving 4 position properties to html element</h2>
    <div class="second-div">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Earum,
      aspernatur ut! Non nesciunt eum aperiam ipsum aliquam molestias officiis
      esse. Iste nisi quibusdam dicta assumenda totam nulla blanditiis hic
      impedit?
    </div>
