    <h1>Inset property in css</h1>
    <p>
      When we give relative position to nay html element than four more
      properties was also unlock with that help we can position our html element
      according to top property, right property, bottom property, and left
      property. We can give these four property in short-hand property too which
      was
      <span
        >inset property with the help of inset property we can give all four
        properties together</span
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Example to see how inset property works</h2>
    <h3>parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="child-element">child element</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      With the help of inset properties we experiment position by giving all 4
      properties in one under the hood.
    </p>
    <h2>
      In inset property precedance will take place among all four properties ???
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes top and left property will take precedance over bottom and right
      properties as per respectively so here also we have to give them negative
      value.
