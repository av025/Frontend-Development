    <h1>Giving left and Right property with relative position</h1>
    <p>
      Similarly like top and bottom property we can give position of our html
      element with the help of left and right property respectively. We can see
      how left and right property work with example.
    </p>
    <h2>Giving right and left property to relative position html element</h2>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="child-left">Giving left property</div>
      <div class="child-right">Giving right property</div>
    </div>
    <h2>Explanation of above example</h2>
    <h3 class="explanation">left property</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The blue color div element we give relative position and also give left
        property 1000px than our element was move away from left position and
        movetowards the right position of 1000px and create gap from left
        position of it's original position.
        <span
          >Here was also the same thing was apply our html element was move away
          from giving position property we are apply same like margin
          property</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="explanation">Right property</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Here also The same thing happen dark magenta color div element we give
        relative position and also give right property 1000px than our element
        was move away from right position and movetowards the left position of
        1000px and create gap from right position of it's original position.
        <span
          >Here was also the same thing was apply our html element was move away
          from giving position property we are apply same like margin
          property</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Giving negative value to left and right position</h2>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-negative">
      <div class="child-Lnegative">Giving negative value to left property</div>
      <div class="child-Rnegative">Giving ngative value to right property</div>
    </div>
    <h2>Understand what happens when we give negative value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In above child div's we apply negative value on blue color div we give
        -950px left property and on second dark magenta div we give -950px
        right. When we give negative value than left and right properties work
        opposite to it's nature instead of move away div's was move towards the
        left and right position properties.
      </li>
    </ul>
