    <h1>Precedance betweeen left and right property with relative position</h1>
    <p>
      When we give left and right property of relative position together than
      precedance was occur. Let we see with example
    </p>
    <h2>Example to see precedance between left and right property</h2>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="child-element">
        Left property takes precedance between left and right property
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Explanation left property will take precedance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On above example we give child element relative position of parent
        element. We also apply 800px left property first and our html element
        was position 800px away from it's left position than apply right
        property 800px which was not applied due to precdance take place by left
        property because
        <span
          >our html document was start from left side and when we applied right
          and left properties together than collision was happen and our browser
          will not understand what property we have to apply so defaulty left
          property take precedance and applied</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to overcome with precedance situation</h2>
    <p>
      Now we want to apply right property but precedance take place when we use
      both properties togrther than what to do ???
    </p>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="precedance-overcome">
        For that we have to give left property negative value which work same as
        right property
      </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We have to give left property in negativevalue which work same as right
        property.
      </li>
    </ul>
