    <h1>Understand fixed position in depth</h1>
    <p>
      When we give any html element fixed position than it will become fixed to
      viewport and that html elment was also relative to viewport if the size of
      page become bigger than it our html element become scorllable too!!!!.
    </p>
    <h2>Giving positions properties</h2>
    <p>Let see how our four position properties work with fixed position</p>
    <div class="example-one">
      We give fixed position to this div element and give top property 30px.
      <br />
      Here we give 30px top property than our position was caluclated from
      viewport top because we give top property so it create gap from top of
      100px.
    </div>
    <div class="example-two">
      We give this div position fixed and give bottom property 30px.
      <br />
      Here we give 30px bottom property than our position was caluclated from
      viewport bottom because we give bottom property so it create gap from
      bottom of 30px.
    </div>
    <div class="example-three">
      We give this div position fixed and give left property 700px.
      <br />
      Here we give 700px left property than our position was caluclated from
      viewport left because we give left property so it create gap from left of
      700px.
    </div>
    <div class="example-fourth">
      We give this div position fixed and give right property 800px.
      <br />
      Here we give 800px right property than our position was caluclated from
      viewport right because we give right property so it create gap from right
      of 800px.
    </div>
    <a href="../inset property with fixed position/index.html"
      >Inset property with fixed position</a
    >
