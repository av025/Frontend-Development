    <h1>Top and bottom property with absolute position</h1>
    <p>
      When we give absolute position to any html element than it was relative to
      it's non-static parent element and try align relative to it's parent
      element For position of our html element we have four properties also
      which was unlock and accessible when we give non-static position which was
      <span>top property</span>, <span>right property</span>,
      <span>bottom property</span>, and <span>left property</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of top and bottom property with absolute position</h2>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="child">Child element</div>
    </div>
    <h2>Explanation of above example</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Above we give parent element position relative and child element
        position absolute because absolute property work with non-static
        position element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Than apply top property of 50px to child element so our child element
        will move downwards and create gap of 50px from top position.
      </li>
      <li>
        After top property we also give bottom property 50px and here we
        surprise that bottom property was also in absolute element and our child
        element will move upwards and create gap of 50px from bottom position we
        assume that this top and bottom property work same like
        <span>margin property</span> we assume that for our understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >So here from both position top and bottom applied from 50px and left
          over spaces was cover by html element like a height and we don't want
          that left space html element was consider as height than we have to
          use max-height the additional css property to control height of
          element.</strong

      </li>
    </ul>
