    <h1>Introduction to Absolute Position</h1>
    <p class="giving-margin">
      When we give any html element position Absolute than it was relative to
      nearest nont-static (Aka relative position or other position property
      mainly fixed) ancestor element.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span
        >When absolute position html element was not having non-static ancestor
        element than it was relative to root element of our html
        document.Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow,
        and can overlap elements</span
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Example to see the absloute position giving to HTML element</h2>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="child-element">Child Element</div>
