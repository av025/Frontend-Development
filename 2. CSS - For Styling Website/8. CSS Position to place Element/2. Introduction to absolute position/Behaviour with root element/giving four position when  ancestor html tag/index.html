      <h2>Explanation of above what are happeing</h2>
      <p>
        When we give non-static position element absolute position than it was
        relative to it's root element {html element} or viewport and try to
        align itself same as root elment or viewport. Above we apply four
        direction properties with the help of inset property and give value
        100px 400px two value which respectively. Tp top and bottom property we
        give 100px which means here our html element will away from viewport top
        and bottom of 100px and create gap between them. Similarly we give left
        and right property 200px which create gap between from left and right
        position of viewport.
