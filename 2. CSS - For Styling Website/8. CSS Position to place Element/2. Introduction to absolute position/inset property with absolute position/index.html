    <h1>Inset property with absolute position</h1>
    <p>
      Inset property was short hand property of the 4 position properties
      <span>top</span>, <span>right</span>, <span>bottom</span>, and
      <span>left properties</span> to do positioning.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of inset property with absolute position</h2>
    <h3>Parent element</h3>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <div class="child-element">Child element</div>
    </div>
    <h2>Conclusion of above example</h2>
    <p>
      We give inset property to child element and here position was apply from
      all 4 direction we give 100px to inset property so 100px apply from all
      four direction. Here also same problem happeing direction was applying
      from all 4 position so after 100px the space left our child element
      acquire as width and height. We can control that also by giving max-width
      & max-height.
