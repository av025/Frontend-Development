    <h1>em unit in depth</h1>
    <p>We see that em unit was related to it's parent element font-size.</p>
    <h2>Example of em unit</h2>
    <div class="parent-div">
      <h3 class="parent-item">Parent element</h3>
      <p class="parent-item">
        We set font-size of parent div 24px to give child and deceandent element
        in em unit because em unit was depend on parent element font-size.
      </p>
      <div class="child-div">
        <h3 class="child-item">Child element</h3>
        <p class="child-item">
          We give child element font-size was 2em so it was 48px because em unit
          was related to parent element so it's parent div we set font-size 24px
          so child element we give 2em which was 2 times of 24 which was 48px.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently child element has 48px font-size
        </p>
        <div class="children">
          <h3 class="children-item">Children of Child element</h3>
          <p class="children-item">
            Children element we give font-size again 2em so here the font-size
            was 96px beacuse em unit was relatable to it's parent element
            font-size and child element font-size was 48px.
