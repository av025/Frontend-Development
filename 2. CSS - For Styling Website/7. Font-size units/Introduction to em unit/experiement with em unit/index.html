    <h1>Experiment with em units</h1>
    <h2>Giving width in em unit</h2>
    <p>
      When we give width in em unit than html element width was calculated and
      related to parent element font-size.
    </p>
    <h3>Giving width in em unit</h3>
    <div class="width-example">
      We give width to these div element in em unit, So it's width was
      caluclated from parent's element font-size and parent of div element was
      body tag and default font-size of almost element was 16px
    </div>
    <p>
      We give width in em unit and value was 20em so div element width was 20
      times of body tag font-size 20 x 16 = 320px. Width of above div element
      was 320px
    </p>
    <h3>Set font-size of child element</h3>
    <div class="case">
      When we set font-size of Child element than width was related to child
      element font-size if we are giving width in em unit.
    </div>
    <p>
      We are giving width 20em so here width was calculated from child's
      font-size which was 32px because we set font-size so 20 times of 32px =
      640px hence the width of above div was 640px.
