    <h1>Introduction to em unit</h1>
    <p>
      We know that font-size property was inherited in nature. It passes from
      parent element to desecandent elements. So, em unit was also like that it
      related or we say depend on parent element.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of em unit</h2>
    <div class="first-example">
      Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad expedita,
      voluptas esse accusamus minima sed incidunt fuga voluptate eligendi sunt?
    </div>
    <p class="explanation">
      We known that default font-size was set by the browser was 16px which
      equals to <b style="color: deeppink">1em</b>. So above div element parent
      was body element and we give 2em font-size to it. So font-size of div
      element was 32px because. div element parent body tag font-size was 16px
      {default} and we give div element font-size 2em so caluclation like 2 X 16
      = 32px basically 2 Times of 16px.
    </p>
    <div class="second-example">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ullam ipsam in
      laborum, adipisci recusandae optio consectetur incidunt delectus beatae.
      Expedita.
    </div>
    <p class="explanation">
      Above div element we are giving 3em to font-size which was 3 times of
      parent element font-size which was 16 X 3 = 64px. Hence this div element
      was has 64px font-size.
    </p>
    <p class="conclusion">
      em unit was also relative unit which depends on parent element font-size.
