    <h1>Introduction to Font-size unit in css</h1>
    <p>
      We known that default font-size of every html element was 16px which given
      by user agent stylesheet (Aka default styling by browser ) except some
      html element has smaller font-size to 16px also for example button element
      <br />
      <br />
      Basically Default styling was not 16px it was <span>1em</span>
