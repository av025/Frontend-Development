    <h1>rem unit in depth</h1>
    <p>
      When we give em unit to any html element for font-size property than there
      font-size was related to root element font-size and root element was html
      element and default user style sheet font-size was 16px so here we change
      the font-size of html element.
    </p>
    <p class="root-selector">
      Giving font-size 24px to html element which was root element but here we
      use root selector.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of giving em unit</h2>
    <div class="parent-element">
      <h3 class="parent-item">Parent element</h3>

      We give html element font-size 24px which was root element because all
      html element was reside inside HTML element. We give font-size of parent
      element 2rem which was 2 times of root element font-size we give root
      element (Aka HTML element) was 24px so 2 X 24 = 48px so font-size was
      48px.

      <div class="child-element">
        <h3 class="child-item">Child element</h3>
        We give child element font-size 4rem which was 4 times of root-element
        font-size (Aka HTML element) So , here 4 X 24 = 98px so font-size was
        98px.
        <div class="children-node">
          <h3 class="children-item">Children Node of Child element</h3>
          here we give font-size 0.5rem which means half of our font-size of
          root element so half of 24px was 12px. Font-size was 12px. Similarly
          increase in font-size with the help of rem unit we can decrease
          font-size too!!!
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p id="conclusion">
      All Div elements font-size was related to Root element HTML Element
      font-size
    </p>
  </body>
