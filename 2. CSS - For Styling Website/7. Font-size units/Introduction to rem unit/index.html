    <h1>Introduction to rem unit</h1>
    <p>
      rem unit was also relative unit specailly use for font-size property but
      it was not complex like em unit. rem unit was relative to root element
      which was html element and default font-size of html element was also 16px
      or <span>1rem</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of rem unit</h2>
    <div class="rem-unit-example">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nam explicabo
      maxime nemo quis quam beatae aspernatur itaque iste sunt ea.
    </div>
    <p>
      In above example div element we give font-size 2rem when we use rem unit
      than it's font-size was related to root element font-size. Default
      font-size set by browser was 16px so 2 times of 16px was 32px here
      font-size of div element was 32px.
    </p>
