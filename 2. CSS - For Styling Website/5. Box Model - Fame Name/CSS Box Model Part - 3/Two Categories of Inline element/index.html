    <h1>Two categories of Inline element</h1>
    <p>There was two types of inline element</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non - replaced Inline element</li>
      <li><a href="" id="link">Replaced Inline element</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-replaced Inline element</h2>
    <p>
      The inline element in which we can write our content and than we can't
      give height and width , padding and border was also overlaping to another
      html element when we give in top & bottom direction and we can't give
      margin in top and bottom direction this is due to it's inline nature.
    </p>
