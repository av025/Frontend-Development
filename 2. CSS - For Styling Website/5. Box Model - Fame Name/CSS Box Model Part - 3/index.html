    <h1>Box Model With Inline Element</h1>
    <p class="explanation">
      Now we see how our box-Model will work with Inline HTML element
    </p>
    <p id="example-block-level">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Fuga, quos!
    </p>
    <span class="inline-element-one"
      >Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptate harum
      dolor laboriosam! Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing
      elit. Praesentium, nam.</span

      We know that every html element was wrap in the box which was box-model
      but in inline level element box-model properties was not apply properly
      for example we give height = 300px and width = 300px to first inline
      element both the properties was not applied. Here Height and width was
      auto it depends on the content if the content was more it increase it's
      height and width and we can say that inline element was not wrap in box
      shape it has some other same nor rectangle or square.
