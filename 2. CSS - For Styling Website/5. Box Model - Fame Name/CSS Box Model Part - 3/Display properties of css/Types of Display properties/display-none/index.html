    <h1>Display none property in css</h1>
    <p>
      With the help of Display none property we can hide our html element from
      rendering on the viewport that html element was not seen on viewport than
      we give display none property.
    </p>
    <span class="one">One</span>
    <span class="two">Two</span>
    <span class="three">Three</span>
    <h3>What was difference between hidden attribute and display none ?</h3>
    <p>
      When we are giving hidden attribute to any html element than it was
      implicitly display:none only
    </p>
    <div class="example" hidden>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ducimus ex
      dolores maiores quod distinctio maxime rem quibusdam voluptatem illum
      eaque suscipit earum, minus nemo dignissimos aliquam dolorum dolorem
      reprehenderit! Nihil cupiditate beatae ut vero fugiat facilis distinctio
      dolorum eum voluptatem.
    </div>
    <p>
      Above we have gave the div element hidden attribute than after in css we
      give display block so it was over-write by display block property hidden
      attribute has low specificity it can be change or anipulate by css display
      properties
    </p>
