    <h1>Problem with font-size when we give viewport unit</h1>
    <p>
      Here the problem was when we give font-size in viewport unit than
      font-size related to its browser's viewport. When our viewport size
      decreases than font-size was also decreases so it was not readable.
    </p>
    <h2>Example to see problem with font-size</h2>
    <div class="example">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. At obcaecati
      nobis corrupti ratione quo repellendus maiores ipsum! Velit, fuga placeat.
    </div>
    <p>
      Here the problem was when we decrease the viewport size the size was
      font-size was also decreases so it create problem for readable.
