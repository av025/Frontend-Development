    <h1>Understand padding giving in percentage ( In depth )</h1>
    <p>
      We see that whenever we give padding to any html elements in percentage
      unit than it takes padding from its parent element width
    </p>
    <h2>Example of giving html element padding in percentage</h2>
    <div class="parent-element">
      parent Element
      <div class="child-element">Child Element</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      We give 10 percent padding to parent element which padding was calculated
      from its parent width which was body tag
    </p>
    <p>
      Than we give padding 20 percent padding to child element which was
      calculated from parent element width
    </p>
    <h2>
      Using percentage unit on padding with box-sizing : content-box property
    </h2>
    <div class="parent-content-box">
      Parent Element
      <div class="child-content-box">Child Element</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      When box-sizing property was content-box than it's padding was taken from
      it's parent content-box width not total width.
