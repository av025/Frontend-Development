    <h1>Conclusion to Percentage unit</h1>
    <p>
      When we used percentage unit to any html element than every property was
      related to it's parent element property on what we are giving perecentage
      value.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When we give width & height in percentage unit to any html element than
        thier width and height was calculated to from there parents height and
        width.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we give padding, margin in percentage unit than our padding and
        margin was also calculated from parent element width.
      </li>
      <li>Percentage unit was not work with border property !!!!</li>
      <li>
        On font-size this same concept apply but here our font-size value was
        calculated from parent's font-size.
      </li>
    </ul>
