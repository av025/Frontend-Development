      We give this pink div position first relative so it becomes relative to
      it's parent element and give top property 50% and bottom property 50%. But
      it doesnot center in viewport because relative position does not flow
      different from normal flow direction of HTML element. it does not look it
      center so we have to use translate transform property to center it so we
      give translate -50% in both axis x and y so it centered but not according
      to viewport.
    </p>
    <p class="conclusion-absolute">
      In orange div we give position absolute so when we give any html element
      absolute position so it flow different from normal flow of html document
      if these absolute position does not have non-static parent than it was
      relative to root element or viewport we can say that so we give top 50%
      and left 50% so it comes in center but it does not look it center so we
      have to use translate transform property to center it so we give translate
      -50% in both axis x and y so it perfectly centered.
