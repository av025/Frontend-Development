    <h1>Introduction to Box-shadow Property</h1>
    <p>We use Box-shadow to give shadow to our HTML element</p>
    <div class="box-shadow-example">We give box-shadow to this div element</div>
    <p class="top-position">
      We use box-shadow property to give shadow to this so syntax of box-shadow
      property was first we have to give <span>x-axis</span> shadow position
      than second we have to give <span>y-axis</span> position shadow and for
      third for <span>blur radius</span> we can give shadow blurness with the
      help of third value after that fourth value which was
      <span>spread</span> it helps us to spread our shadow in both x-axis and
      y-axis we give 20px so in our 10px shadow 20px also added in that shadow
      than we choose color to give color for our shadow.
