    <h2>Justify content space between</h2>
    <h3>Flex Container</h3>
    <div class="flex-container-one">
      <div class="flex-item-one-parentOne">Flex-item One</div>
      <div class="flex-item-two-parentOne">Flex-item Two</div>
      <div class="flex-item-three-parentOne">Flex-item Three</div>
      <div class="flex-item-four-parentOne">Flex-item Four</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      When we give justify content space between property than the spaces which
      are left in flex-container so our flex-items was align like that all the
      spaces which are left in flex-container was now between our flex-item and
      the flex-items which are at the corner was align close to our
      flex-container or stick to flex-container and the spaces was given between
      our flex-items was given equally to all flex-item.
    </p>
    <h2>Justify content space around</h2>
    <h3>Flex container</h3>
    <div class="flex-container-two">
      <div class="flex-item-one-parentTwo">Flex-item One</div>
      <div class="flex-item-two-parentTwo">Flex-item Two</div>
      <div class="flex-item-three-parentTwo">Flex-item Three</div>
      <div class="flex-item-four-parentTwo">Flex-item Four</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      When we give justify space around property so the spaces which are left in
      our flex-container was take places around our flex-items so we can say
      that when we give justify content spaces around than spaces are come
      around our flex-item and spaces was distributed equally but at the corners
      the spaces was half of the spaces was between.
    </p>
    <h2>Justify content space evenly</h2>
